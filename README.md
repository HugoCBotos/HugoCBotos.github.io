<h1 id="hugo-cattarucci-botós">Hugo Cattarucci Botós</h1>
<p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of São Paulo (Instituto de Matemática e Estatística - IME), in Brazil. My research focuses mainly on hyperbolic geometry, differential topology, and geometric topology. Currently, I am interested in dynamical systems as well. This website was created to provide access to my texts and videos for anyone interested.</p>

Previously, I was a postdoc at the Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik (MPIM) in Germany, from March 2023 to August 2023, and a temporary professor at the University of São Paulo (Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação - ICMC), from July 2022 to February 2023.
